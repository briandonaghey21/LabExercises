This program was created by Brian Donaghey and Christian Estey. This program will take your name and how you are feeling and it will create a sentence with those two pieces of information. 

We chose to use the Apache License 2.0 because it allows us to freely distribute without having to take back the old code. Also using the wikipedia page provided, we saw it also fit the rest of what we needed. We chose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct because it is widely used by everyone, and we do not need the other code of conduct because it is made for big communities.
